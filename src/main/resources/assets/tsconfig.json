  // Important: exclude only changes which files are included as a result of
  // the include setting. A file specified by exclude can still become part of
  // your codebase due to an import statement in your code, a types inclusion,
  // a /// <reference directive, or being specified in the files list.
  // It is not a mechanism that prevents a file from being included in the
  // codebase - it simply changes what the include setting finds.
