:toc: right

This starter provides the building blocks for integrating React in Enonic XP on client- and serverside.
 
This covers build steps and runtime: a Gradle/NPM build setup with link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp[a library] and a few link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp[companion NPM packages]. Compiles and serves standard JSX-format React components from XP.

A simple example XP part with React rendering and a barebone page controller is included.

**See link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[the react4xp introduction]** for a tutorial and more comprehensive documentation.

Requires: installed link:https://developer.enonic.com/[Enonic XP 7.x] with link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/getting_started.html[Gradle] and Node/NPM. 





== Install

1. Install the starter from link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-starter[Enonic Market] or clone it down from link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp[the github repo]. 
2. The NPM packages (link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp[react4xp] specifically) must be installed before running the gradle build task. Before you build for the first time, and whenever you wipe the _node_modules_ folder, run: 
+
[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
    npm install
----

3. Build it locally from link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/master[the Enonic CLI] (which runs gradle build behind the scenes): 
+
[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
    enonic project deploy
----



== Easy Content Studio setup after building

For complete setup info, see link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[the react4xp introduction]. 

Crash course, after getting this starter running:

- Start XP
- Enter Content Studio
- Add a Site. Give it a display name and activate this starter app. 
- Select the "Default Page" page controller (and apply/save).

|===
| Version / tag    | Minimum XP version | Notes 

| 1.1.0            | 7.3.0  | Easy-to-set-up guillotine: adds a ready-to-map guillotine API for backend and frontend queries, and a frontend request wrapper. Simplifies the build: NPM package react4xp@1.1.4 replaces a lot of build setup in this parent project's build.gradle with one line (`apply from:`...). And bugfixes style handling in client-side `.renderWithDependencies. 
| 1.0.1            | 7.3.0  | First full release, compatible with updated guide.  
| 0.6.3            | 7.0.0  | Lazy-loading assets on server-side rendering. Collected all the react4xp NPM packages into one. Support: CSS modules with asset handling.  
| 0.6.1            | 7.0.0  | Fixed Page/Layout support. Free structure of entry and chunk directories. Babel upgrade.

|===

This table (and the master branch) covers XP7-compatible code. For XP6-compatible versions, see the link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/tree/XP6_master[XP6_master branch]. 

More code examples: see the link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/tree/examples[examples branch].

Other versions can be found in this repo, but may be differently structured and/or buggy/painful.

== Future development

**Being a first-release**, we will keep working on this intensely. 

For now there are some link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/issues[known issues] we are looking into. Feedback, suggestions, uncovered use cases, problems, or stories of ensuing hilarity are **very welcome here** - it will hugely help us improve the React support in XP!

=== Some notes:
  - You'll note that after (re)starting the server or (re)deploying the app, the SSR engine takes a few seconds to start up. This is for caching the react components on the first rendering, making subsequent server-side renderings of the same component very fast, even with different props.
