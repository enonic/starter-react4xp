# starter-react4xp

This starter provides the building blocks for integrating React in Enonic XP on client- and serverside.

This covers build steps and runtime: a Gradle/NPM build setup with [a library](https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp) and a
few [companion NPM packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@enonic/react4xp). Compiles and serves standard JSX-format React components from
XP.

A simple example XP part with React rendering and a barebone page controller is included.

**See [the react4xp introduction](https://developer.enonic.com/docs/react4xp/stable)** for a tutorial and more comprehensive documentation
or check out the [developer portal](https://developer.enonic.com/) to learn more about the enonic ecosystem.

Requires: installed [Enonic XP 7.15.1](https://developer.enonic.com/)
with [Gradle](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/getting_started_eng.html) and Node/NPM.

## Install

1. The three usual options: 
    - install the starter from [Enonic Market](https://market.enonic.com/starters/react4xp-starter),
   - or clone it down from [the github repo](https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp), 
    - or use [the Enonic CLI](https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/stable):
    ```commandline
    enonic project create -r starter-react4xp
    ```
2. Build it locally: 
    ```commandline
    enonic project deploy
    ```

NOTE: if you use a version of the starter with version 1.1.2 or lower, you will need to run `npm install` before "enonic project deploy" or other gradle/enonic CLI commands.

## Easy Content Studio setup after building

For complete setup info, see [the react4xp introduction](https://developer.enonic.com/docs/react4xp/stable).

Crash course, after getting this starter running:

- Start XP
- Enter Content Studio
- Add a Site. Give it a display name and activate this starter app. 
- [Follow this tutorial](https://developer.enonic.com/docs/react4xp/stable/pages) and select the "Default Page" page controller (and
  apply/save).

This table (and the master branch) covers XP7.15.1-compatible code.

## Future development

React4xp is a work in progress and frequently updated. 

For now there are some [known issues](https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/issues) we are looking into. Feedback, suggestions, uncovered
use cases, problems or stories of ensuing hilarity are **very welcome here** - it will hugely help us improve the React support in XP!

### Some notes:

- You may also have noticed that it took a little time for the first server-side rendering to be displayed. Thatâ€™s the server-side rendering
  engine warming up. It reads and caches the basics (notably, some necessary polyfilling, react and react-dom) for performance.

- This delay only happens when your app is restarted, i.e. you restart XP entirely, or redeploy the app.
