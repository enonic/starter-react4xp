:toc: right

This starter provides the building blocks for integrating React in Enonic XP on client- and serverside.
 
This covers build steps and runtime: a Gradle/NPM build setup with link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp[a library] and a few link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp[companion NPM packages]. Compiles and serves standard JSX-format React components from XP.

A simple example XP part with React rendering and a barebone page controller is included.

**See link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[the react4xp introduction]** for a tutorial and more comprehensive documentation.

Requires: installed link:https://developer.enonic.com/[Enonic XP 7.x] with link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/getting_started.html[Gradle] and Node/NPM. 





== Install

1. The three usual options: 
   - install the starter from link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-starter[Enonic Market], 
   - or clone it down from link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp[the github repo], 
   - or use link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/master[the Enonic CLI]:
+
[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
    enonic project create -r starter-react4xp
----
2. Build it locally: 
+
[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
    enonic project deploy
----

NOTE: if you use a version of the starter with version 1.1.2 or lower, you will need to run `npm install` before "enonic project deploy" or other gradle/enonic CLI commands.

== Easy Content Studio setup after building

For complete setup info, see link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[the react4xp introduction]. 

Crash course, after getting this starter running:

- Start XP
- Enter Content Studio
- Add a Site. Give it a display name and activate this starter app.

[%header,cols=3]
|===
| Version / tag    | Minimum XP version | Notes 

| 1.5.0            | 7.6.0  | Version leap: sync with versions of lib-react4xp (1.5.0) and npm-react4xp (1.5.4), which bring SSR-engine improvements to error reporting and concurrent multi-thread  rendering.
| 1.2.1            | 7.6.0  | Update XP version, remove unused libraries
| 1.2.0            | 7.5.0  | Easier build: no longer needs "npm install" before gradle tasks or "enopnic project deploy".
| 1.1.0            | 7.3.0  | Easy-to-set-up guillotine: adds a ready-to-map guillotine API for backend and frontend queries, and a frontend request wrapper. NPM package react4xp@1.1.4 replaces a lot of build setup in this parent project's build.gradle with one line (`apply from:`...), and bugfixes style handling in client-side `.renderWithDependencies. 
| 1.0.1            | 7.3.0  | First full release, compatible with updated guide.  
| 0.6.3            | 7.0.0  | Lazy-loading assets on server-side rendering. Collected all the react4xp NPM packages into one. Support: CSS modules with asset handling.  
| 0.6.1            | 7.0.0  | Fixed Page/Layout support. Free structure of entry and chunk directories. Babel upgrade.  
| 0.2.10           | 7.0.0  | Fixes windows build issue #18. 
| 0.2.8            | 7.0.0  | Beta release for XP7

This table (and the master branch) covers XP7-compatible code. For XP6-compatible versions, see the link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/tree/XP6_master[XP6_master branch]. 

More code examples: see the link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/tree/examples[examples branch].

Other versions can be found in this repo, but may be differently structured and/or buggy/painful.

== Future development

React4xp is a work in progress and frequently updated. 

For now there are some link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/issues[known issues] we are looking into. Feedback, suggestions, uncovered use cases, problems, or stories of ensuing hilarity are **very welcome here** - it will hugely help us improve the React support in XP!

=== Some notes:
- You'll note that after (re)starting the server or (re)deploying the app, the SSR engine link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/react4xp/master/hello-react#first_serverside_render_can_be_slow[takes a few seconds to start up]. This is for caching the react components on the first rendering, making subsequent server-side renderings of the same component very fast, even with different props.
