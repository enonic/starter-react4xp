// Two standalone (independent of XP components) webapps in one:
//
// <domain:port>/app/<app-key> demonstrates the use of inserted.html that gets an array <urls> from this controller,
// which contains all required URLs for rendering, and uses thymeleaf to insert them into the page.
//
// <domain:port>/app/<app-key>?pure is standalone, doesn't get any data from this controller, but resolves its own URLs.
// This is done using XP's view functions in this case, but the URLs can strictly speaking come from any source - the
// important thing is to point to the React4xp services.
//
// (depending on your setup <domain:port>/app/<app-key> can be e.g. http://localhost:8080/app/com.enonic.app.react4xp )
