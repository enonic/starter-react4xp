    <p>Is this thing on? OK, here comes the React4xp rendering:</p>

    <div id="target"></div>


    <!-- import React4xp and its frontend-core CLIENT (from the react4xp-client) and all its dependency chunks, and the component: -->
    <script data-th-each="url: ${urls}" data-th-src="${url}"></script>

    <!-- Use React4xp.CLIENT to render the SimpleGreeter component into the 'target' element above, with some props: -->
    <script defer>
        React4xp.CLIENT.render(React4xp.SimpleGreeter, 'target', {worldOrSomething: "worldie"});
    </script>

    </body>
