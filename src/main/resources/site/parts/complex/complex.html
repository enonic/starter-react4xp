<div class="complex-container">
    <h2>Here's a slightly complex part</h2>
    <p>Here comes the first react rendering in it:</p>
    <div data-th-id="${targetContainerIdFromController}">

    </div>
    <p>This is the last hardcoded element in the slightly complex part. A second react rendering should be inserted after it, but still inside the "complex-container" element.</p>
</div>
