:toc: right

This starter provides the building blocks for integrating React in Enonic XP on client- and serverside.

This covers build steps and runtime: a Gradle/NPM build setup with link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp[a library] and a few link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp[companion NPM packages]. Compiles and serves standard JSX-format React components from XP.

A simple example XP part with React rendering and a barebone page controller is included.

**See link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[the react4xp introduction]** for a tutorial and more comprehensive documentation.

Requires: installed link:https://developer.enonic.com/[Enonic XP 7.x] with link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/getting_started.html[Gradle] and Node/NPM.





== Install

1. The three usual options:
   - install the starter from link:https://market.enonic.com/vendors/enonic/react4xp-starter[Enonic Market],
   - or clone it down from link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp[the github repo],
   - or use link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/enonic-cli/master[the Enonic CLI]:
+
[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
    enonic project create -r starter-react4xp
----
2. Build it locally:
+
[source,commandline,options="nowrap"]
----
    enonic project deploy
----

NOTE: if you use a version of the starter with version 1.1.2 or lower, you will need to run `npm install` before "enonic project deploy" or other gradle/enonic CLI commands.

== Easy Content Studio setup after building

For complete setup info, see link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[the react4xp introduction].

Crash course, after getting this starter running:

- Start XP
- Enter Content Studio
- Add a Site. Give it a display name and activate this starter app.
- Select the "Default Page" page controller (and apply/save).

NPM package react4xp@1.1.4 replaces a lot of build setup in this parent project's build.gradle with one line (`apply from:`...), and bugfixes style handling in client-side `.renderWithDependencies.

This table (and the master branch) covers XP7-compatible code. For XP6-compatible versions, see the link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/tree/XP6_master[XP6_master branch].

More code examples: see the link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/tree/examples[examples branch].

Other versions can be found in this repo, but may be differently structured and/or buggy/painful.

== Future development

React4xp is a work in progress and frequently updated.

For now there are some link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/issues[known issues] we are looking into. Feedback, suggestions, uncovered use cases, problems, or stories of ensuing hilarity are **very welcome here** - it will hugely help us improve the React support in XP!

=== Some notes:
- You'll note that after (re)starting the server or (re)deploying the app, the SSR engine link:https://developer.enonic.com/docs/react4xp/master/hello-react#first_serverside_render_can_be_slow[takes a few seconds to start up]. This is for caching the react components on the first rendering, making subsequent server-side renderings of the same component very fast, even with different props.
