:toc: right

React4xp starter, for integrating React with Enonic XP. Compiles and serves standard JSX-format React components from XP.

A simple example XP part with React rendering and a barebone page controller is included. **See link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[the react4xp introduction]** for a tutorial and links to more comprehensive documentation.

== Quick overview

This starter provides the building blocks for client- and serverside React support in Enonic XP: a Gradle/NPM build setup with link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp[a library] and a few link:https://www.npmjs.com/package/react4xp[companion NPM packages]. 

Prerequisites: installed link:https://developer.enonic.com/[Enonic XP 7.x] with Gradle and Node/NPM. 


== Easy setup after building: 

For complete setup info, see link:https://developer.enonic.com/templates/react4xp[the react4xp introduction]. Crash course, after getting this starter running:

- Start XP
- Enter Content Studio
- Add a Site. Give it a display name and activate this starter app. 
- Select the "Default Page" page controller (and apply/save).
- You now see a drag and drop region. Insert a part.
- In the dropdown menu, choose the "Hello React" part.

More code examples: see the link:https://github.com/enonic/starter-react4xp/tree/examples[examples branch].

Other versions can be found in this repo, but may be differently structured and/or buggy/painful.

== Future development

This being a **first-release**, we will keep working on this intensely.

For now there are a couple of link:https://github.com/enonic/lib-react4xp/issues[known issues] we are looking into. Feedback, suggestions, uncovered use cases, problems, or stories of ensuing hilarity are **very welcome here** - it will hugely help us improve the React support in XP!

=== Some notes:
  - You'll note that after (re)starting the server or (re)deploying the app, the SSR engine takes a few seconds to start up. This is for caching the react components on the first rendering, making subsequent server-side renderings of the same component very fast, even with different props.
